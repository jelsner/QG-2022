Elsner (he/him/his) Instructor Location: Bellamy Building, Room 323a Lesson Hours: MWF 9:05-9:55 a.m. Student Hours: MWF 10-10:30 a.m. Email: jelsner@fsu.edu Course description This course is an introduction to the quantitative analysis of geographic data (data analysis for geographers). Most of the course content will be available through Canvas and through RStudio Cloud. Please open an account with RStudio Cloud at (https://rstudio.cloud). Please use this link https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/12733/join?access_code=NuhGFcK71GlGuzoKzAUIe1lqgcMDyOIC7UnnFtNG to join the Spatial Data Analysis workspace on RStudio Cloud. Expected learning outcomes You will describe and demonstrate the principles of data science. You will do this with a grammar for manipulating data and a grammar for making graphs. The grammars are implemented in R using the syntax of tidyverse. Materials You will need access to the internet and either an iPad, laptop, or desktop computer. All course materials are available through RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/12733/projects) and archived on Canvas. There is no required textbook. Much of the material for the course comes from the online book: R for Data Science https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ Additional help is available online (e.g., https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html) Class meetings Online: synchronous, interactive, asynchronous recordings available on Canvas Some lectures, lots of learn-by-doing Grades Grades are determined solely by how well you do on the regularly scheduled homework/classwork assignments. There are NO quizzes, tests, or exams. Synchronous attendance is expected but not required. Late classwork or homework assignments will not be accepted. Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 (outstanding) are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 (good) at least a B-, and 70 - 79 (satisfactory) at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after all work is complete. Academic honor code http://www.eng.fsu.edu/~peterson/fsuhc.html Students With Disabilities Act Students needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center (https://dos.fsu.edu/sdrc/); (2) bring a letter to me indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done sometime during the first week of classes. Diversity &amp; inclusiveness Students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives will be well-served by this course. Student learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that you bring to this class will be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official FSU records, please let me know. If you feel your performance is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives/identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

Are hurricanes getting stronger? Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. Today Understand what this course is about, how it is structured, and my expectations for you Start working with RStudio Cloud What is this course? This is a first course on data science for geographers. Q - What statistics background does this course assume? A - None. Q - Is this an intro stat course? A - Statistics and data science are closely related with much overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. But this course is not your typical high school/college statistics course. Q - Will we be doing computing? A - Yes. Q - Is this an introduction to computer science course? A - No, but many themes are shared. Q - What computing language will we learn? A - R. Q - Why not language some other language? A - We can discuss that over coffee (Zoom only). 0.1 Where is this course? RStudio Cloud 0.1.1 Join RStudio Cloud Go to RStudio Cloud, and log in.

Click on the project 00_Syllabus and launch it. Open the 00-Syllabus.Rmd file (lower-right panel), and then click on the “Knit” button. Review 0.1.4 Tallahassee Daily Temperatures Click on the project 01_Lesson and launch it. When you access a project created by someone else, RStudio Cloud automatically creates a temporary copy of the original project for you. You can play with and make edits to it, but none of your changes will be reflected in the original. To keep the changes you’ve made, just save a copy of the project for yourself by pressing the Save a Permanent Copy button. In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, locate the file called Tallahassee_Temperatures.Rmd. Open it, and then click on the “Knit” button. Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the yaml – we’ll talk about what this means later) and knit again. Then, change the temperature from TMAX to TMIN. Make other adjustments accordingly. Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization! Any questions? Use chat or unmute.
