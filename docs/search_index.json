Data science (formerly known as ‘statistics’) is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. Today Understand what this course is about, how it is structured, and my expectations for you Start working with RStudio and R. What is this course? This is designed as first course in data science for geographers. Q - What statistics background does this course assume? A - None. Q - Is this an intro stat course? A - Statistics and data science are closely related with much overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. But this course is not your typical high school/college statistics course. Q - Will you be doing computing? A - Yes. Q - Is this an introduction to computer science course? A - No, but many themes are shared. Q - What computing language will you learn? A - R. Q - Why not language some other language? A - We can discuss that over coffee.
