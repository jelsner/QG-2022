Are Atlantic hurricanes getting stronger? Data science is an exciting discipline that turns data into understanding, insight, and knowledge. This course teaches you data science in the context of geography. Today What this course is about, how it is structured, and what I expect from you Getting started with R and RStudio What is this course? This is a first course in data science for geographers. Q - What statistics background does this course assume? A - None. Q - Is this an intro statistics course? A - Statistics and data science are closely related with much overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. But this course is not your typical high school/college statistics course. Q - Will you be doing computing? A - Yes. Q - Is this an introduction to computer science course? A - No, but many themes are shared. Q - What computing language will you learn? A - R. Q - Why not language some other language? A - We can discuss that over coffee. Where are the materials for this course? Github Examples Some of my recent research: More hots Stronger tornadoes Other research: A year as told by fitbit by Nick Strayer R-Ladies global tour by Maelle Salmon Syllabus Navigate to https://github.com/jelsner/QG-2022 Click on the file labeled 00-Syllabus.Rmd Click on the button [Raw] You can Save as to download a copy to your computer Getting set First get R Go to http://www.r-project.org. Select the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Scroll to a mirror site. Choose the appropriate file for your hardware. Follow the instructions to install R. Then get RStudio Go to on http://rstudio.org Download RStudio Desktop Install and open RStudio Finally (Optional), learn git https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html RStudio’s integrated development environment (IDE) Written in HTML Top menus File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Appearance Upper left panel is the markdown file. This is where we put our text and code. Run code chunks from this panel Output from the operations can be placed in this panel or in the Console (see the gear icon above) All the text, code, and output can be rendered to an HTML file or a PDF or Word document (see the Knit button above) Upper right panel shows what is in your current environment and the history of the commands you issued. This is also where you can connect to github Lower left panel is the Console I think of this as a sandbox where you try out small bits of code. If it works and is relevant move it to the markdown file. This is also where output from running code will be placed. Not a place for plain text Lower right panel shows your project files, the plots that get made, and all the packages associated with the project. The File tab shows the files in the project. The most important one is the .Rmd. The Plot tab currently shows a blank sheet The Packages tab shows all the packages that have been downloaded from CRAN and are associated with this project. Example: Tallahassee daily temperatures Packages &gt; Install In the Packages window, type tidyverse, lubridate, here, ggplot2 then select Install Get the data into your environment. TLH.df &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = here::here(&#39;data&#39;, &#39;TLH_SOD1892.csv&#39;), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt; dplyr::filter(STATION == &#39;USW00093805&#39;) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(Date = as.Date(DATE)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(Year = lubridate::year(Date), Month = lubridate::month(Date), Day = lubridate::day(Date), doy = lubridate::yday(Date)) |&gt; dplyr::select(Date, Year, Month, Day, doy, TMAX, TMIN, PRCP) package::function (:: is called a library specifier). Or, load the packages into your current environment with the library() function. Create a plot showing the frequency of daily high temperatures in Tallahassee. library(ggplot2) TLH.df |&gt; dplyr::group_by(TMAX) |&gt; dplyr::summarize(nH = dplyr::n()) |&gt; ggplot(mapping = aes(x = TMAX, y = nH)) + geom_col(col = &#39;white&#39;, fill = &quot;gray70&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Frequency of Daily High Temperatures&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Tallahassee, FL, USA (1940-2018)&quot;, x = &quot;Daily High Temperature (°F)&quot;, y = &quot;Number of Days&quot;) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 20, to = 110, by = 10)) + theme_minimal() ## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (position_stack).
