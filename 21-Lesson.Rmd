## Other neighborhood definitions {.unnumbered}

Autocorrelation plays a central role in spatial statistics by quantifying the degree to which nearby things tend to cluster. Moran's I is one metric of spatial clustering. 

The value of Moran's I depends on how 'nearby' is defined (neighborhood definition) and on how the neighbors are weighted. Various neighbor definitions are possible and the choice will influence the value of any statistic of spatial autocorrelation.

Let's consider the historical demographic data in Mississippi counties. Import the data as a simple feature data frame and assign the geometry a geographic CRS.

```{r}
if(!"police" %in% list.files(here::here("data"))) {
download.file(url = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/police.zip",
              destfile = here::here("data", "police.zip"))
unzip(here::here("data", "police.zip"),
      exdir = here::here("data"))
}

( PE.sf <- sf::st_read(dsn = here::here("data", "police"), 
                 layer = "police") |>
  sf::st_set_crs(4326) )
```

Variables in the simple feature data frame include police expenditures (`POLICE`), crime (`CRIME`), income (`INC`), unemployment (`UNEMP`), percentage of people identifying as white (`WHITE`) and other socio-economic characteristics across Mississippi at the county level. 

Police expenditures are per person (1982 dollars). Crime is the number of serious crimes per 100,000 people (1981). Personal income is per person (1982 dollars). Unemployment is percent of people looking for work (1980).

The geometries are polygons that define the county borders.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = PE.sf) +
  geom_sf()
```

To estimate autocorrelation for any variable in the data frame, you need to first define neighbors and assign weights for each polygon.

The default options in the `spdep::poly2nb()` and `spdep::nb2listw()` result in neighbors defined by 'queen' contiguity (polygon intersections can include a single point) and weights assigned using row standardization (the sum of the weights equals the number of regions).

```{r}
nbs <- PE.sf |>
  spdep::poly2nb()
wts <- nbs |>
  spdep::nb2listw()
```

Alternatively you can specify the number of neighbors and then define neighbors based on proximity (closeness). Here you first extract the coordinates of the polygon centroids as a matrix.

```{r}
coords <- PE.sf |>
  sf::st_centroid() |>
  sf::st_coordinates()

coords |>
  head()
```

Then use the `spdep::knearneigh()` function (K nearest neighbors) on the coordinate matrix and specify the number of neighbors with the `k =` argument. Here you set it to six. That is, allow each county to have 6 neighbors based on proximity.

Since the CRS is geographic you need to include the `longlat = TRUE` argument so distances are calculated using great circles.

```{r}
knn <- coords |>
  spdep::knearneigh(k = 6, 
                    longlat = TRUE)

knn |>
  names()
```

The output is a list of five elements with the first element a matrix with the row dimension the number of counties and the column dimension the number of neighbors.

A look at the first six rows of the matrix.

```{r}
knn$nn |>
  head()
```

The first county has county 9, 3, 2, 4, 10, and 14 as neighbors.

Note that by using distance to define neighbors the matrix is not symmetric. For example, county 3 is a neighbor of county 2 (row 2 contains a 3), but county 2 is not a neighbor of county 3 (row 3 does not contain a 2).

Certain statistical models require the neighbor matrix to be symmetric. That is if region X is a neighbor of region Y then region Y must be a neighbor of region X.

You turn this matrix into a neighbor object (class `nb`) with the `spdep::knn2nb()` function.

```{r}
nbs2 <- knn |>
  spdep::knn2nb()

nbs2 |>
  summary()
```

If you include the argument `sym = TRUE` in the `knn2nb()` function then it forces the neighbor matrix to be symmetric.

```{r}
nbs3 <- knn |>
  spdep::knn2nb(sym = TRUE)

nbs3 |>
  summary()
```

The result shows that six is now the minimum number of nearest neighbors with some counties having has many as 10 neighbors to guarantee symmetry.

Compare the default adjacency neighborhoods with the nearest-neighbor neighborhoods.

```{r}
PE.sf |>
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot(border = "grey")
nbs |>
  plot(coords, add = TRUE)

PE.sf |>
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot(border = "grey")
nbs2 |>
  plot(coords, add = TRUE)
```

A difference between the two neighborhoods is the number of links on counties along the state borders. The nearest-neighbor defined neighborhoods have more links. Note: when neighbors are defined by proximity counties can share a border but they still may not be neighbors.

Choice of neighbors is based on domain specific knowledge. If the process you are interested in can be described by a dispersal mechanism then proximity definition might be the right choice for defining neighbors. If the process can be described by a border diffusion mechanism then contiguity might be the right choice.

Create weight matrices for these alternative neighborhoods using the same `spdep::nb2listw()` function.

```{r}
wts2 <- nbs2 |>
  spdep::nb2listw()

wts3 <- nbs3 |>
  spdep::nb2listw()
```

You compute Moran's I for the percentage of white people variable (`WHITE`) with the `moran()` function separately for the three different weight matrices.

```{r}
spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE,
             listw = wts,
             n = length(nbs),
             S0 = spdep::Szero(wts))

spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE,
             listw = wts2,
             n = length(nbs2),
             S0 = spdep::Szero(wts2))

spdep::moran(PE.sf$WHITE,
             listw = wts3,
             n = length(nbs3),
             S0 = spdep::Szero(wts3))
```

Values of Moran's I are constrained between -1 and +1. In this case the neighborhood definition has little impact on inferences made about spatial autocorrelation. The kurtosis is between 2 and 4 consistent with a set of values from a normal distribution.

In a similar way you compute the Geary's C statistic.

```{r}
spdep::geary(PE.sf$WHITE, 
             listw = wts,
             n = length(nbs), 
             S0 = spdep::Szero(wts), 
             n1 = length(nbs) - 1)
```

Values of Geary's C range between 0 and 2 with values less than one indicating positive autocorrelation.

If the values of Moran's I and Geary's C result in different interpretations about the amount of clustering then it is a good idea to examine _local_ variations in autocorrelation.

## Assessing the statistical significance of autocorrelation {-}

Moran's I and Geary's C measure the amount of autocorrelation in spatial data. But it is important to understand that attribute values placed arbitrarily across a spatial domain will result in some amount of autocorrelation just by chance. 

Statistical tests provide a way to guard against being fooled by this chance autocorrelation. So it is important to ask, is the value of Moran's I significant with respect to the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation?

One way to answer this question is to draw an uncertainty band on the regression line in a Moran scatter plot. If a horizontal line can be placed entirely within the band then the slope, which is equivalent to Moran's I, is not significant against this null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

Compute a spatially-lagged unemployment variable. Start by putting the unemployment values in a vector called `unemp` then use the `spdep::lag.listw()` function with the standardize weights as the first argument and the vector of the unemployment as the second argument.

```{r}
unemp <- PE.sf$UNEMP
Wunemp <- spdep::lag.listw(wts, 
                           unemp)
```

Finally make a Moran's scatter plot.

```{r}
data.frame(unemp, Wunemp) |>
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = unemp, y = Wunemp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  xlab("Unemployment") + 
  ylab("Average neighborhood unemployment") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Since a horizontal line can not be placed entirely within the gray band, the slope (Moran's I) is significant against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.

More formally the question of whether Moran's I is statistically significant is answered by comparing the standard deviate ($z$ value) of Moran's I to the appropriate value from a standard normal distribution. This is done using the `spdep::moran.test()` function, where the $z$ value is the difference between I and the expected value of I divided by the square root of the variance of I.

The function takes a variable name or numeric vector and a spatial weights list object in that order. The argument `randomisation = FALSE` means the variance of I is computed under the assumption of normally distributed unemployment (`UNEMP`) rates.

```{r}
( mt <- spdep::moran.test(PE.sf$UNEMP, 
                          listw = wts,
                          randomisation = FALSE) )
```

Moran's I is .218 with a variance of .0045. The $z$ value for I is 3.41 giving a $p$-value of .0003 under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. Thus you reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is weak but statistically significant autocorrelation in unemployment rates across Mississippi at the county level.

Outputs from the `spdep::moran.test()` function are in the form of a list.

```{r}
str(mt)
```

The list element called `estimate` is a vector of length three containing Moran's I, the expected value of Moran's I under the assumption of no autocorrelation, and the variance of Moran's I. 

The $z$ value is the difference between I and it's expected value divided by the square root of the variance.

```{r}
( mt$estimate[1] - mt$estimate[2] ) / sqrt(mt$estimate[3])
```

The $p$-value is the area under a standard normal distribution curve to the right (`lower.tail = FALSE`) of 3.4102 (`mt$statistic`), the red vertical line in the plot below.

```{r}
pnorm(mt$statistic, 
      lower.tail = FALSE)

curve(dnorm(x), from = -4, to = 4, lwd = 2)
abline(v = mt$statistic, col = 'red')
```

So about .03% of the area lies to the right of the red line.

The $p$-value summarizes the evidence in support of the null hypothesis. The smaller the $p$-value, the less evidence there is in support of the null hypothesis. 

The small $p$-value tells you that the spatial arrangement of the data is unusual with respect to the null hypothesis.

The interpretation of the $p$-value is stated as evidence AGAINST the null hypothesis. This is because interest lies in the null hypothesis being untenable. A $p$-value less than .01 is said to provide _convincing_ evidence against the null, a $p$-value between .01 and .05 is said to provide _moderate_ evidence against the null, and a $p$-value between .05 and .15 is said to provide _suggestive, but inconclusive_ evidence against the null. A $p$-value greater than .15 is said to provide _no_ evidence against the null. 

Note you do not interpret _no_ evidence as _no_ autocorrelation.

Under the assumption of normally distributed and uncorrelated data, the expected value for Moran's I is -1/(n-1) where n is the number of regions. 

A check on the distribution of unemployment rates indicates that normality is somewhat suspect. A good way to check the normality assumption is to use the `sm::sm.density()` function from the {sm} package.

```{r}
sm::sm.density(PE.sf$UNEMP, 
               model = "Normal",
               xlab = "Unemployment Rates")
```

The unemployment rates are less "peaked" (lower kurtosis) than a normal distribution. In this case it is better to use the default `randomisation = TRUE` argument in the `spdep::moran.test()` function.

Further, the assumptions underlying Moran's test are sensitive to the form of the graph of neighbor relationships and other factors so results should be checked against a test that involves permutations.

A random sampling approach to inference is made with the `spdep::moran.mc()` function. MC stands for Monte Carlo which refers to the city of Monte Carlo in Monaco famous for its gambling casinos.

The name of the data vector and the weights list object (`listw`) are required as is the number of permutations (`nsim`). Each permutation is a random rearrangement of the unemployment rates across the counties. This removes the spatial autocorrelation but keeps the non-spatial distribution of the unemployment rates. The neighbor topology and weights remain the same.

For each permutation (random shuffle of the data values), I is computed and saved. The $p$-value is obtained as the ratio of the number of permuted I values equal to or exceeding the observed I over the number of permutation plus one. In the case where there are 5 permuted I values greater or equal to the observed value based on 99 simulations, the $p$-value is 5/(99 + 1) = .05.

For example, if you want inference on I using 9999 permutations type

```{r}
set.seed(40453)

( mP <- PE.sf$UNEMP |>
    spdep::moran.mc(listw = wts,
                    nsim = 9999) )
```

Nine of the permutations yield a Moran's I greater than .218, hence the $p$-value as evidence in support of the null hypothesis (the true value for Moran's I is zero) is .0009.

Note: you initiate the random number generator with a seed value (any will do) so that the set of random permutations of the values across the domain will be the same each time you run this code chunk. This is important for reproducibility. The default random number generator seed value is determined from the current time (internal clock) and so no random permutations will be identical. To control the seed use the `set.seed()` function.

The values of I computed for each permutation are saved in the vector `mP$res`.

```{r}
mP$res |> 
  head()

mP$res |>
  tail()
```

The last value in the vector is I computed using the data in the correct counties. The $p$-value as evidence in support of the null hypothesis that I is zero is given as

```{r}
sum(mP$res > mP$res[10000])/9999
```

A density graph displays the distribution of permuted I's.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(mp = mP$res[-10000])

ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = mp)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_rug() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mP$res[10000], 
             color = "red", size = 2) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The red line indicates the value of Moran's I using the data in the correct counties. All but nine of values are lower (to the left of the red line).

The density curve is centered just to the left of zero consistent with the theoretical expectation (mean).

What do you do with the knowledge that the unemployment rates have significant autocorrelation? By itself, not much, but it can provide notice that something might be going on in certain regions (hot spot analysis).

The knowledge is more useful after other factors are considered. Knowledge of significant autocorrelation in the model residuals can help you improve the model.

## Bivariate spatial autocorrelation {-}

The idea of spatial autocorrelation can be extended to two variables. It is motivated by the fact that aspatial bi-variate association measures, like Pearson's correlation, do not recognize the spatial arrangement of the regions.

Consider the correlation between police expenditure (`POLICE`) and the amount of crime (`CRIME`) in the police expenditure data set.

```{r}
police <- PE.sf$POLICE
crime <- PE.sf$CRIME

cor.test(police, crime, 
         method = "pearson")
```

You note a significant (direct) correlation ($p$-value < .01) exists between these two variables. 

But you also note some significant spatial autocorrelation in each of the variables separately.

```{r}
police |>
  spdep::moran.test(listw = wts)

crime |>
  spdep::moran.test(listw = wts)
```

The Lee statistic integrates the Pearson correlation as an aspatial bi-variate association metric with Moran's I as a uni-variate spatial autocorrelation metric. The formula is

$$
L(x,y) = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij})^2}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij}(x_i-\bar{x})) ((\sum_{j=1}^{n}w_{ij}(y_j-\bar{y}))}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

The formula is implemented in the `spdep::lee()` function where the first two arguments are the variables of interest and you need to include the weights matrix and the number of regions. The output from this function is a list of two with the first being the value of Lee's statistic (`L`).

```{r}
spdep::lee(crime, police, 
           listw = wts, 
           n = length(nbs))$L
```

Values of L range between -1 and +1 with the value here of .13 indicating relatively weak bi-variate spatial autocorrelation between crime and police expenditures. You interpret this to mean that crime in a county has some influence on police expenditure in that county AND some influence on police expenditure in the neighboring counties, but not much.

The `crime` and `police` variables can not be adequately described with a normal distribution.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
sm::sm.density(crime, model = "normal")
sm::sm.density(police, model = "normal")
```

Thus you perform a non-parametric test on the bi-variate spatial autocorrelation with the `spdep::lee.mc()` function. The crime and police expenditure values are randomly permuted and values of Lee's statistic (`L`) are computed for each permutation.

```{r}
spdep::lee.mc(crime, police, 
              listw = wts, 
              nsim = 999)
```

Based on a $p$-value that exceeds .05 you conclude that there is no significant bi-variate spatial autocorrelation between crime and police expenditure in these data.

## Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation {-}

The Moran's I statistic was first used in the 1950s. Localization of the statistic was presented by Luc Anselin in 1995.

Earlier you saw the `raster::MoranLocal()` function from the {raster} package returns a raster of local Moran's I values.

Local I is a deconstruction of global I where geographic proximity is used in two ways. (1) to define and weight neighbors and (2) to determine the spatial scale over which I is computed.

Using queen's contiguity you determine the neighborhood topology and the weights for the police expenditure data from Mississippi. Here you print them in the full matrix form with the `spdep::list2mat()` function.

```{r}
round(spdep::listw2mat(wts)[1:5, 1:10], 2)
```

The matrix shows that the first county has three neighbors 2, 3, and 9 and each get a weight of 1/3. The third county has four neighbors 1, 4, 9 and 10 and each gets a weight of 1/4.

Compute local Moran's I on the percentage of white people using the `spdep::localmoran()` function. Two arguments are needed (1) the attribute variable for which you want to compute local correlation and (2) the weights matrix as a list object.

```{r}
Ii_stats <- PE.sf$WHITE |>
  spdep::localmoran(listw = wts)

Ii_stats |>
  str()
```

The local I values are stored in the first column of a matrix where the rows are the counties. The other columns are the expected values for I, the variances of I, the $z$ values and the $p$-values. For example, the local I statistics from the first six counties are given by typing

```{r}
Ii_stats |>
  head()
```

Because the local I values must average to the global value (when using row standardized weights), they can take on values outside the range between -1 and 1. A `summary()` method on the first column of the `Li`  object gives statistics from the non-spatial distribution of I's.
```{r}
summary(Ii_stats[, 1])
```

To make a map of the values, you start by attaching the matrix columns of interest to the simple feature data frame. Here you attach `Ii` (local Moran's), `Vi` (variance), and `Pi` ($p$-value).

```{r}
PE.sf$Ii <- Ii_stats[, 1]
PE.sf$Vi <- Ii_stats[, 3]
PE.sf$Pi <- Ii_stats[, 5]
```

Then you use {ggplot2} together with the `geom_sf()` function to make a thematic map.

```{r}
( g1 <- ggplot(data = PE.sf) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = Ii)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "green",
                       high = "blue") )
```

You also map the variances.

```{r}
ggplot(data = PE.sf) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = Vi)) +
  scale_fill_gradient()
```

Variances are larger for counties near the boundaries because the sample sizes are smaller.

Compare the map of local autocorrelation with a map of percent white. 
```{r}
( g2 <- ggplot(data = PE.sf) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = WHITE)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "black",
                      high = "white") )
```

Plot them together.

```{r}
library(patchwork)

g1 + g2
```

Areas where percent white is high over the northeast are also areas with the largest spatial correlation. Other areas of high spatial correlation include the Mississippi Valley and in the south. The county with the most negative spatial correlation (green) is the county in the northwest with a fairly high percentage of whites neighbored by counties with much lower percentages of whites.
