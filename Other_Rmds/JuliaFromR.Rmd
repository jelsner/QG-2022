## Installation
You can install {JuliaCall} just like any other R packages by
```{r}
install.packages("JuliaCall")
```

To use {JuliaCall} you must have a working installation of Julia. This can be easily done via:
```{r}
library(JuliaCall)
install_julia()
```

## Basic Usage

Before using {JuliaCall}, you need to do initial setup by function `julia_setup()` for automatic type conversion, Julia display systems, etc. It is necessary for every new R session to use the package. 

If not carried out manually, it will be invoked automatically before other `julia_xxx()` functions. Solutions to some common error in `julia_setup()` are documented in the troubleshooting section.

```{r}
library(JuliaCall)
julia <- julia_setup()
```

Does not work with arm64e architecture.
