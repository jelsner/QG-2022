## Course description and expected learning outcomes {.unnumbered}

This course is an introduction to the quantitative analysis of geographic data (data science for geographers). All the course content is available on GitHub <https://github.com/jelsner/QG-2022>

You will demonstrate the core principles of data science as applied to geographic data. You will do this with a grammar for manipulating data and a grammar for making graphs. The grammars are implemented in R using the syntax of tidyverse.

Materials

-   You will need access to the internet and a laptop or desktop computer
-   All course materials are available through GitHub <https://github.com/jelsner/QG-2022>
-   There is no required textbook
-   Much of the material for the course comes from the online book: R for Data Science <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>
-   Additional help is available online (e.g., <https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html>)

Class meetings

During each lesson I will work through and explain the R code contained within an `xx-Lesson.Rmd` file. Lessons will be held in this classroom (BEL 320). The lesson files are comprehensive, so you can work through them on your own if you can't make it to class on a particular day.

The notes are written using the markdown language. Markdown is a way to write content for the Web. An R markdown file has the suffix `.Rmd` (R markdown file). The file is opened using the RStudio application.

## Grades and ethics {.unnumbered}

You are responsible for:

1.  Reading and running the code in the lesson R markdown files (`.Rmd`) files. You can do this during the remote lessons as I talk and run the code or you can work through the file outside of class on your own.
2.  Completing and returning the assignments on time.

Grades are determined entirely by how well you do on the assignments.

There are no quizzes, tests, or exams.

Grades are based on the following rubric:

-   A: Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions
-   B: Good: only minor errors/omissions
-   C: Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission
-   D: Poor: several major errors/omissions
-   F: Fail: many major errors/omissions

I'll use the +/- grading system.

Grades will be posted as they are recorded on [FSU Canvas](https://canvas.fsu.edu)

Americans With Disabilities Act

Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should: (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center; (2) bring a letter indicating the need for accommodation and what type. This should be done during the first week of classes.

Diversity and inclusiveness

It is my intent to present notes and data that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.

## Deeper dives {.unnumbered}

-   [Best practices for working with R](https://twitter.com/DanOvand0/status/1309223236740083712) Develop a project-oriented work flow and don't use `setwd()`. Don't hard-coded file path names. Use version control (github). Manage package dependencies. Pick a style of writing code and stick with it. Do as much as you can in RMarkdown (notes, lectures, slides, etc). Check out [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/).
