- Wrangling data

## Wrangling data frames {-}

You will wrangle data with functions from the {dplyr} package. The functions work on data frames but they work better if the data frame is a _tibble_. Tibbles are data frames that make life a little easier. 

R is an old language, and some things that were useful 10 or 20 years ago now get in the way. To make a data frame a tibble (tabular data frame) type
```{r}
airquality <- as_tibble(airquality)
class(airquality)
```

Click on `airquality` in the environment. It is a data frame.

Selecting and filtering

The function `select()` chooses variables by name to create a data frame with fewer columns. For example, choose the month, day, and temperature columns from the `airquality` data frame.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::select(Month, Day, Temp)
```

Suppose you want a new data frame with only the temperature and ozone concentrations.
```{r}
df <- airquality |>
        dplyr::select(Temp, Ozone)
df
```

You include an assignment operator (`<-`, left pointing arrow) and an object name (here `df`).

Note: The result of applying most {dplyr} verbs is a data frame. The take only data frames and return only data frames.

The function `filter()` chooses observations based on specific values. 
![filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/dplyr_filter.jpg)

Suppose you want only the observations where the temperature is at or above 80F.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Temp >= 80)
```

The result is a data frame with the same 6 columns but now only 73 observations. Each of the observations has a temperature of at least 80F.

Suppose you want a new data frame keeping only observations where temperature is at least 80F AND winds less than 5 mph.
```{r}
df <- airquality |> 
  dplyr::filter(Temp >= 80 & Wind < 5)
df
```

Example: Palmer penguins

Let's return to the penguins data set. The data set is located on the web, and you import it as a data frame using the `readr::read_csv()` function.
```{r}
loc <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv"
penguins <- readr::read_csv(loc)
penguins
```

To keep only the penguins labeled in the column `sex` as `female` type
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(sex == "female")
```
  
To filter rows keeping only species that are not Adalie penguins.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(species != "Adelie")
```

When the column of interest is a numerical, you can filter rows by using greater than condition. For example, to create a data frame containing the heaviest penguins you filter keeping only rows with body mass greater than 6000 g.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(body_mass_g > 6000)
```
  
You can also filter rows of a data frame with less than condition. For example, to create a data frame containing only penguins with short flippers you filter keeping only rows with flipper length less than 175 mm.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(flipper_length_mm < 175)
```
  
You can also specify more than one conditions. For example to create a data frame with female penguins that have larger flippers you filter keeping only rows with flipper length greater than 220 mm and with sex equal to female.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(flipper_length_mm > 220 & 
                sex == "female")
```

You can also filter a data frame for rows satisfying one of the two conditions using OR. For example to create a data frame with penguins have large flippers or short bills you filter keeping rows with flipper length of at least 220 mm or with bill depth less than 10 mm.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(flipper_length_mm > 220 | 
                bill_depth_mm < 10)
```
  
Often you want to remove rows if one of the columns has a missing value. With `is.na()` on the column of interest, you can filter rows based on whether or not a column value is missing.

Note the `is.na()` function returns a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
```{r}
is.na(airquality$Ozone)
```
The first four rows of the vector `Ozone` in the `airquality` data frame are not missing so the function `is.na()` returns four `FALSE`s. 

When you combine that with the `filter()` function you get a data frame containing all the rows where `is.na()` returns a `TRUE`. For example, create a data frame containing rows where the bill length value is missing.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(is.na(bill_length_mm))
```
 
Usually you will want to do the reverse of this. That is keep all the rows where the column value is not missing. In this case use negation symbol `!` to reverse the selection. In this example, filter rows with no missing values for `sex` column.
```{r}
penguins |> 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(sex))
```

Note that this filtering will keep rows with other column values that are missing values but there will be no penguins where the `sex` value is `NA`.

Stringing functions together

The function `arrange()` orders the rows by values given in a particular column.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::arrange(Solar.R)
```

The ordering is from lowest value to highest value. Here the first 10 rows. Note `Month` and `Day` are no longer chronological.

Repeat but order by the value of air temperature.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::arrange(Temp)
```

Importantly you can string the functions together. For example select the variables radiation, wind, and temperature then filter by temperatures above 90F and arrange from coolest to warmest by temperature.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::select(Solar.R, Wind, Temp) |>
  dplyr::filter(Temp > 90) |>
  dplyr::arrange(Temp)
```

The result is a data frame with three columns and 14 rows arranged by increasing temperatures above 90F. 

The `mutate()` function adds new columns to the data frame. 
![mutate](figures/dplyr_mutate.png)

For example, create a new column called `TempC` as the temperature in degrees Celcius. Also create a column called `WindMS` as the wind speed in meters per second.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::mutate(TempC = (Temp - 32) * 5/9,
                WindMS = Wind * .44704) 
```

The resulting data frame has 8 columns (two new ones) labeled `TempC` and `WindMS`.

On days when the temperature is below 60 F add a column giving the apparent temperature based on the cooling effect of the wind (wind chill) and then arrange from coldest to warmest apparent temperature.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Temp < 60) |>
  dplyr::mutate(TempAp = 35.74 + .6215 * Temp - 35.75 * Wind^.16 + .4275 * Temp * Wind^.16) |>
  dplyr::arrange(TempAp)
```

Summarize

The `summarize()` function reduces (flattens) the data frame based on a function that computes a statistic. For example, to compute the average wind speed during July type
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Month == 7) |>
  dplyr::summarize(Wavg = mean(Wind))

airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Month == 6) |>
  dplyr::summarize(Tavg = mean(Temp))
```

You already seen functions that compute statistics on vectors including `sum()`, `sd()`, `min()`, `max()`, `var()`, `range()`, `median()`. Others include

Summary function  | Description
-----------------:|:-----------
`dplyr::n()`             | Length of the column
`dplyr::first()`         | First value of the column
`dplyr::last()`          | Last value of the column
`dplyr::n_distinct()`    | Number of distinct values

Find the maximum and median wind speed and maximum ozone concentration values during the month of May. Also determine the number of observations during May.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Month == 5) |>
  dplyr::summarize(Wmax = max(Wind), 
            Wmed = median(Wind), 
            OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), 
            NumDays = dplyr::n())
```

Why do you get an `NA` for `OzoneMax`? 

Fix this by including the argument `na.rm = TRUE` inside the `max()` function.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::filter(Month == 5) |>
  dplyr::summarize(Wmax = max(Wind),
            Wmed = median(Wind),
            OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = dplyr::n())
```

Grouping by column name

If you want to summarize separately for each month you use the `group_by()` function. You split the data frame by some variable (e.g., `Month`), apply a function to the individual data frames, and then combine the output.

Find the highest ozone concentration by month. Include the number of observations (days) in the month.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::group_by(Month) |>
  dplyr::summarize(OzoneMax =  max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = dplyr::n())
```

Find the average ozone concentration when temperatures are above and below 70 F. Include the number of observations (days) in the two groups.
```{r}
airquality |>
  dplyr::group_by(Temp >= 70) |>
  dplyr::summarize(OzoneAvg =  mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = dplyr::n())
```

On average ozone concentration is higher on warm days (Temp >= 70 F) days. Said another way; mean ozone concentration statistically depends on temperature.

The mean is a model for the data. The statistical dependency of the mean implies that a model for ozone concentration will likely be improved by including temperature as an explanatory variable.

To summarize, the important verbs are

Verb          | Description
-------------:|:-----------
`dplyr::select()`    | selects columns; pick variables by their names
`dplyr::filter()`    | filters rows; pick observations by their values
`dplyr::mutate()`    | creates new columns; create new variables with functions of existing variables
`dplyr::summarize()` | summarizes values; collapse many values down to a single summary
`dplyr::group_by()`  | allows operations to be grouped

The syntax of the verb functions are all the same:

Properties
* The first argument is a data frame. This argument is implicit when using the `|>` operator.
* The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You refer to columns in the data frame directly (without using `$`).
* The result is a new data frame

These properties make it easy to chain together many simple lines of code to do something complex.

The five functions form the basis of a grammar for data. At the most basic level, you can only alter a data frame in five useful ways: you can reorder the rows (`arrange()`), pick observations and variables of interest (`filter()` and `select()`), add new variables that are functions of existing variables (`mutate()`), or collapse many values to a summary (`summarise()`).

Your turn

Consider again the Florida precipitation data set (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLprecip.txt). Import the data as a data frame, select the columns `April` and `Year`, group by years > 1960, then compute the mean and variance of the April rainfall with the `summarize()` function.
